# SocksChat

A very basic [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and Socket.io chat room app with a layout based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate). This was created so I could learn Socket.io. The chat lacks flood control or other administrative features you would want in a real web app. Starter code is from gaarf's [express-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaarf/express-boilerplate)

# Interesting Files:

	* client-side javascript in public/javascripts/chat.js
	* server-side javascript in app.js
	* HTML in views/index.ejs and views/layout.ejs

# Installation:

	* make sure node.js is installed
	* copy files to server, cd to sockschat directory.
	* run # node app.js
	* open up http://yourdomain:3000 in a browser.
	
# Notes:

	* Only tested in Chrome
	* Socket.io is really fun to use and Express makes a lot of sense.
